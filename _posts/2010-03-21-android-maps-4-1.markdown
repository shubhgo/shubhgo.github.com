When I read about the new version of maps (4.1) on android I got really excited cause it has integrated features like live wallpapers and including google latitude. The really wanted to try it out so I got the emulator running and here are some screen shots.

**Live wallpaper with maps as background**

The emulator does not come with the maps app and the market app by default so they have to be installed separately. I was able to install the maps app by pointing my browser to the required .apk file I still han't been able to get the market running.
