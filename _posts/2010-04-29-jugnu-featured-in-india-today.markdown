Jugnu, the IIT Kanpur nano satellite has been featured in India Today. It is one of the most innovative projects in Science and Technology happening in India. Work on Jugnu started last year and is a very ambitious project. Jugnu is a satellite which would orbit the earth like other satellites, but what makes it special is that it weighs slightly over 3.5kgs and leverages on the latest technologies. Conventional satellites weigh over 100kgs and the cost of putting them into space is high because of the added weight. Jugnu will be India's first Nano Satellite.
