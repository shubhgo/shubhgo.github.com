**Nanital** is where I did my first AOL advance course and it was quite an experience. For the fist time in my life I wondered why I felt like smiling all the time and if the feeling of making a difference is something shared by every soul on the planet. After the course it felt like I slept through most meditation exercises and wasn't cut out for it. But the very day the course ended I felt more aware and creative. I was beaming with ideas and was slighter better at every thing I did. It took me three more courses and four more years to understand the value of what I had learn't in that course. Since then I have decided to do one every year. This past year has been full of challenges and surprises and I can't wait to hop on to the narrow gauge train to Nainital.
