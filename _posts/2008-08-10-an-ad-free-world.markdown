You can now choose not to watch any ads on Yahoo! and Google by opt-out. You can do it for [Yahoo! at here](http://info.yahoo.com/privacy/us/yahoo/opt_out/targeting/details.html), and [Google at here](http://www.google.com/privacy_ads.html). This may hurt their revenue, but since most people may be lazy to do so, it is expected the advertisements can still be delivered. Will you choose to “opt-out”, anway?
