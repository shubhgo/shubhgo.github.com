Yesterday was the day of the roken iPhones. Early morning Kshitij's iPhone got shattered as it dropped face down F L A T on the ground. There was no sound and after 5 secs melancholic vapors started spreading though out the lab.... After a few hours another student working at the same spot dropped and shattered his phone :)
