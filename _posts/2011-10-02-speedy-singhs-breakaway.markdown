Being a die heart skating fan I had to watch this movie. Having said that, there is also Russel Peters and Anupam Kher. The movie is about a guy who loves to play ice hokey and is living in Canada. His family is Punjabi and are trying to stay culturally rooted. The boy rebels, plays, wins and makes every one proud. Have we heard this before... Ahhm (Bend it like Beckham). Despite the cliched story and pushed in romance, the movie is extremely amusing. Word of caution: there is a English and a Hindi dubbed version. WATCH IT IN ENGLISH! save your moral soule from the "Peshap Police"
