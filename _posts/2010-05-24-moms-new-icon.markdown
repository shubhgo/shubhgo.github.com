Last night we designed a logo for the Indian Railways project we have been working on. The project has been code named MOMS which stands for MEMS based oscillation measuring device. Its a very cool concept that was incepted right here in our Mechanical Engineering Dept last year. It uses sensors to detect faults in the railway tracks and then plots them onto a map on a small screen device for easy repair. Once this cost effective solution is implemented repairing and monitoring railway tracks could be done in a jiffy.
