This ridiculous phenomenon is captures by a being made up of 70% H2O and with scarce signs of motor skills and intelligence.[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/SiWZEh6r4wI/AAAAAAAACYo/3aJjSbr8Cgg/s400/IMG_0374.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/SiWZEh6r4wI/AAAAAAAACYo/3aJjSbr8Cgg/s1600-h/IMG_0374.jpg)After roughly taking 300 shots, I was finally able to capture the lightening. Second shot for a comparison.[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/SiWZELoRkuI/AAAAAAAACYg/N1K4GCTqzgA/s400/IMG_0373.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/SiWZELoRkuI/AAAAAAAACYg/N1K4GCTqzgA/s1600-h/IMG_0373.jpg)
