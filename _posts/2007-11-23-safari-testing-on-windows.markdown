Now before I begin I must confess that I am a die hard Firefox fan. IÂ 

some times wish that even my iPhone had firefox!!! It actually took a  
lot of convincing in the first place for me to give safari a proper  
try. A friend of mine from the the firefox fan club had recently  
swiched to a mac and he was claiming safari to be a much better  
experience.  
After testing for a few days some of the features that immidiately  
caught my attention were:  
- blazing fast speed. I mean really really fast. Its draws up pages  
faster than any other thing out there.  
- autocompletes web addresses as we type.  
- font smoothening makes the web a treat for the eyes  
- very easy to setup and configure as fewer intelligent opions  
- spell and grammar check. A feature every modern browser should have.  
- a very slick interface. The rolling out and the zooming out windows  
are a pleasure to have.

Now some of the things that I am generally used to and am them missing  
here  
- my scrapbook on orkut is missing.(apparently its a bug in the orkut  
website code)  
- download manger does not show the percentage downloaded in the title  
bar like firefox. So there is no way to know if a download has started  
after clicking on a link. In firefox the window label generally  
highlights if something new is happening.  
- no integrated 3rd party download manager that can be installed like  
a plugin at least not for the windows version.  
- in the bookmarks page shifting folders around is a pain. Especially  
in the highest level folder tree. Also what's the folder called  
bookmarks menu for? (update: I think I got it. It seems be the list of  
bookmarks in the dropdown bookmarks menu)  
- lacks the feature to open files directly with their default program  
instead of downloading it first. I use torrents a lot and earlier  
firefox would automatically open the torrent file from my browser  
window in my favourote torrent client.  
- no suggestions in the search box unlike firefox which gives a drop  
down list of suggestions.  
- also no default option to pick a search engine apart from google or  
yahoo. In firefox I have all kinds of search engines installed IMDB,  
Wikipedia and more.  
- also no option to force pages that are supposed to be opened in a  
new window to open in a new tab. Firefox has this option and you don't  
end up openinig a new window accidently.

All in all safari is a excellent browser but it is a better choice on  
a mac than on a PC because on a mac you can customize it a whole lot  
better using apple scripts and the plugins available.

I hope you liked my review.  Will be writing another one for the new  
firefox 3Beta. Please leave a comment.
