Actually there were two. Lately its been raining almost every day. If not a proper rain, we are at least blessed with a drizzle. Making my last few days here very very memorable.Its like party time for the peacocks, going out with the peahens, jumping from one tree to another, dancing and munching up stuff in our canteen through out the day.
