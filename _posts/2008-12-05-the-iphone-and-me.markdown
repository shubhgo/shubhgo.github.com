After a lot of contemplating I finally went for the iPhone 3g. The phone as expected is awesome. It has GPS and unlimited GPRS from airtel. Plus I get push emails (I receive them the minute they are sent to me on my phone) which is great. Push email is something I have alway wanted. Here are some pics professionally clicked by Kshitij.
