MOMS: MEMS based Oscillation Measuring Device

MEMS: MicroElectroMechanical Systems

MOMS is a projects we worked on in collaboration with the Indian railways and Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur. Basically its a small gadget, the size of an iPhone. It can be placed on the floor of a train to record faults on a railway track. It records the latitude and longitude of the fault. It has an inbuilt memory card on which all the data is logged. The data can also be visualized on an accompanying tablet using the onboard bluetooth module. The device is a huge time and effort saver because its portable, battery operated, low cost and automated. Its a huge improvement over the fault logging device that the Indian Railways had before this, which weighted over 50 kgs.
