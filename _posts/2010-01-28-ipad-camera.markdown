**iPad**

Apple iPad was launched today and its an awesome device. Now, some of the questions on my mind are.. can I actually use it as a desktop and phone replacement. i.e PenDrive support? Camera?

After playing around with the SDK I saw an option to click and add photographs to contacts. Hidden hints from Apple may be??

For USB Pen drive support the iPad Camera Connection Kit seems to be very promising.
