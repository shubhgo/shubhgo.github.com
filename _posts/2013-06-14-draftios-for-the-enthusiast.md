This post is a work in progress. I created this to help my friend learn iOS. He has a background in programming but hasn't coded in a while. I will be working closely with him to clarify doubt and explore new concepts. This is by no means a stand alone guide at this stage for starting off with Objective-C

##Step 1:
###Learn Objective-C on the Mac
For OS X and iOS

There are a lot of big words used and a there is quite a bit of text used to explain things. But as you go through them you may find your self skimming through them as things come back to you. You can go slower if you want. Do it at a pace that makes sense for you.

Day 1: Basic basic

- Chapters 2, 3, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15
- Ignore Chapter 4,5,6

Day 2: We start off with Object Oriented Stuff

- Chapters 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23 ,24

Day 3: Foundation framework. The layer provided over Objective-C by apple to make our life easier.

- Chapters 25, 26, 27, 28 ,29 
- Skip 30, 31, 32, 32, 34. These chapters talk about file handling and preprocessor directives. We'll deal with these while writing code, as they would make more sense with real life examples.

##Step 2:
Start thinking about a small project that you would like to build along with this course. This would help you solve real world development issues. Ideally the app should have some data to deal with, some network calls and some user input. A twitter client is generally a good idea.
