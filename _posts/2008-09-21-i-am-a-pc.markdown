This is hilarious.....  
I'll tell you the complete story.....  
Once upon a time there was a company called Apple Inc. They had a habit of mocking the completion. So they made advertisements to jeer at the opponent. In  1984 it was IBM.  
  
  
  
And two decades later it was Microsoft. (I am a Mac ad series)  
  
  
  
(check out more ads at [http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/](http://www.apple.com/getamac/ads/)......if you havn't already seen them, see them now, they are hysterically funny)  
  
In 2008 some thing changed. An opponent with deep pockets decided to strike back.  
  
  
(Check out [http://www.microsoft.com/windows/](http://www.microsoft.com/windows/))  
It was a great come back. Many rich and influential people joined the campaign. But then there was this just teny tiny thing.......These ads were partly done on macs..[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/SNVsCuWZ1II/AAAAAAAABSQ/O0NX0bZqv_I/s400/imapc_made_on_mac_420px.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/SNVsCuWZ1II/AAAAAAAABSQ/O0NX0bZqv_I/s1600-h/imapc_made_on_mac_420px.jpg)Check out this article from [computer world](http://www.computerworld.com/action/article.do?command=viewArticleBasic&articleId=9115120&intsrc=hm_list) for more.
