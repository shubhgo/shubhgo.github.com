I dont know how to explain this phenomenon. My head is filled with so   
many ideas.  
I try with out mixing them all up.  
Our department (ME, IIT Kanpur) has been making a lot of efforts   
lately to show off the ahead of its time research going on. Today I   
found out they have taken it to another level. They never realized   
that a clock in sync with 7 satellites form around the globe could   
take us to a new dimension in time. So as we are already there might   
as well enjoy it, because its not every day that you witness the 32nd   
of July..:)  
Welcome to the land of longer months.  
I thought only Indian time was stretched (IST- Indian Stretched Time)  
Cheers  
Shubham

PS: Thanks a lot to Saket for the mid night discovery. It made my day.
