Hi  
Recently discovered cool office software like iWork (for Mac OS x)but need to type those damm equations in the document too...... Try [LATEXiT](http://ktd.club.fr/programmation/latexit_en.php). It is a small program which writes equations in Latex and creates small PDFs which can then be dragged and dropped into various programs. Its easy to create eqations and they look great too. The only down side is that you will have to learn a little Latex.....but millions of tutorials exhist online.  
So let me know if you use this software and like it.
