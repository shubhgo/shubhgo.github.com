Hi

Its been almost a month since I launched Speed.Dial. The app has grown and more and more people are using it and liking it :)

Here are some of the reviews I got:

"_Fortunately, one developer was tricky enough to figure out how to make this common feature request a reality._" -[iphone.appstorm.net](http://iphone.appstorm.net/roundups/productivity-roundups/4-innovative-ways-to-dial-a-friend-on-your-iphone/)

"_Perfect for making a one-touch “call home” button._" -[wellappointeddesk.tumblr.com](http://wellappointeddesk.tumblr.com/post/4109611917/speed-dial-for-iphone-is-a-clever-little-0-99)

The website has been updated. Check out [whatanapp.com](http://whatanapp.com)

A new version of the app with feedback from customers has been uploaded to appstore for review. [Gurpratap](http://gurpartap.com/) has been a great help in the whole process.

The app has grown to #139 in the utility section, but I only dream of the featured region.
