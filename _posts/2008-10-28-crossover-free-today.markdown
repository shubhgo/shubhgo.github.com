Hi  
Get crossover for Mac and Linux free today from the Codeweaver website  
Go to  
http://down.codeweavers.com/  
and get free copies of crossover. Crossover is used by Mac and Linux users to run windows programs on Mac and Linux machine. The advantage is u don't have to virtualize (boot in to windows from your operating system) windows. It just runs the windows program like a native program. I am yet to test it on a Mac but on Linux it works wonderfully especially for MS Office.  
Cheers
