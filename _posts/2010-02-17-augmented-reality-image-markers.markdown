Today I have been playing with image markers for creating virtual 3d objects in the augmented space and its the coolest technology ever. Its a exciting new technology and the best way to understand it is to play with it. So head over to  [http://ge.ecomagination.com/smartgrid/#/augmented_reality](http://ge.ecomagination.com/smartgrid/#/augmented_reality) for a demo. You'll need to take a print out and a computer with a webcam. If you dont happen to have all that check out the video below and get a feel of the technology.

  


  


  


Another great site which has a software for virtualizing famous monuments on the face of the planet is: [http://www.arsights.com/](http://www.arsights.com/)

Follow the instructions on their site and view the Taj Mahal to the Eiffel Tower in 3d.

The Taj Mahal on my desk.

  


Another cool implementation is on Toyota's site.

BMW also made a small little game where you can create life size BMWs to miniature ones and race them along like toy cars.

A BMW in my hands

I'll be posting more examples and sample code as I go along.
