I watched the most awesome Telugu movie today which completely changed my opinion about south Indian movies, music, sense of direction, cinematography and selection of actors. If you get a chance don't miss it. Its a romantic movie about a guy who leads a pretty idealistic life inside the house and lives by his father's wishes because of his respect for him, but when it comes to marriage and love he and his family learn a lot about each other because of a new member they have.

This is me reporting from campus at 5:13 AM in the morning.
