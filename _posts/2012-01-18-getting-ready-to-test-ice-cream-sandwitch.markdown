I have been so engrossed with iOS stuff that I never got a chance to test out two of the new mobile OS on the market, namely Android Ice Cream Sandwich(ICS) and Windows Mobile 7/7.5(WM). To push things further [Parneeth(@lifeeth)](twitter.com/lifeeth) has been telling me that Android has delivered the promise in ICS and every one in Bangalore is using it. To remedy the situation I got hold of a friend with a Samsung Galaxy S I9000 and decided to put ICS on it.

I am happy to report that after 4hrs of stumbling around I have ICS running on the device. Now I plan to use it for a week and see whats new.

Some resources that helped me in flashing ICS on the phone:

1) http://code.google.com/p/ice-cream-sandwich-sgs/

2) http://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=1398223&highlight=kernel

PS: Somethings that I already like:

1) On pressing the delete button in the mail app the default action is the mail being deleted and an undo button is shown, which fades away. On every other OS there is a dialoge bos which say "Are you sure" read "You idiot. Do not make a mistake". Software should be forgiving and this is definitely a good move. Here is an interesting talk by Matt Gemmell where he talks why popups suck. [Making Mistakes Impossible](http://vimeo.com/18623069)

2) Cellular Data Usage Cap. With this one the boys at Mountain View have hit the nail in the head.
