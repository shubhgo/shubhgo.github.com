As we strolled through the campus of Indian Institute of Technology Kanpur (IITK) (www.iitk.ac.in) this chipmunk catches our eye. He casually strolls out of his bed (read: climb downs his tree) and heads over to the cafe for some early morning wakeup drink (read: goes and drinks ketchup from a bottle which has been unintentionally left outside by the cafe manager).

IITK is a place where flora and fauna coexists with their bipedal brothers. Peacocks and a whole plethora of bird species can be seen yodeling, doodling, pecking, munching and making out :)
