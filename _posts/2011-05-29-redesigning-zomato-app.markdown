Zomato is a great service which helps discover great place to eat at or get food delivered from. They recenlty launched their much awaited iPhone app and it has been very useful from day one. The app brings a lot of features to the phone and is visually apealing and easy to navigate. It can be downloaded from: [http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zomato/id434613896?mt=8](http://itunes.apple.com/us/app/zomato/id434613896?mt=8)

 

As an application designer and developer I have a tinkling to poke around and see how things would have been had they been developed in a parallel universe, so I decided to make slight modifications to the app applying the [The Gestalt Principles](http://graphicdesign.spokanefalls.edu/tutorials/process/gestaltprinciples/gestaltprinc.htm).

 

 

This is what I came up with:
