Hi. Its a beautiful evening and I am Shubham reporting from Hall of residence 1,Geek land. It has been sometime since I last reported on the blog, but please don't give up on it. Its just that a last week during the Holi break I went to Udaipur and since I came back I have been in the holiday mode.  The good news is that I had a lot of pictures thanks to my friend Prasoon who might I add selflessly took.    

All I have to say about Udaipur:

Udaipur is a city studded with lakes in the beatuiful Aravali hills plated with a rich clutural history. It truly is a jewel in the Indian crown.

Some pics from my trip:[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/R_rIjxk5GnI/AAAAAAAABAY/QZJ1Q_an1wA/s320/shubham+085.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/R_rIjxk5GnI/AAAAAAAABAY/QZJ1Q_an1wA/s1600-h/shubham+085.jpg)[![](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/R_rIKxk5GmI/AAAAAAAABAQ/m9DMN4XN6Jw/s320/shubham+187.jpg)](http://1.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/R_rIKxk5GmI/AAAAAAAABAQ/m9DMN4XN6Jw/s1600-h/shubham+187.jpg)[![](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/R_rHBRk5GkI/AAAAAAAABAA/5DLMnV0w2Zo/s320/shubham+00+%2881%29.jpg)](http://3.bp.blogspot.com/_BQ0a8k-GX20/R_rHBRk5GkI/AAAAAAAABAA/5DLMnV0w2Zo/s1600-h/shubham+00+%2881%29.jpg)
