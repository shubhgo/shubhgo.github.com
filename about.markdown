I am an iOS developer and designer. I did my B.Tech and Masters in Mechanical Engineering from [IIT Kanpur, India](http://www.iitk.ac.in/). For my thesis I work with General Motors on optimizing the steering system. I worked on India's first Nano satellite [JUGNU](http://www.iitk.ac.in/me/jugnu/index.htm) and also helped develop a [gadget](http://momsiitk.wordpress.com/moms/) for the Indian railways. I am currently making [beautiful iPhone and iPad apps](http://whatanapp.com) and having a heck of a time doing so.

I enjoy photography and [skating](http://www.k2skates.com/inline-skates/il-capo).
